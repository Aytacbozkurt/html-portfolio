<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a mining engineer. I worked in Turkey as a mine machinery sales representative/manager.  I have moved to Germany end of 2019 right before the corona pandemic start. I focused to learn German during my stay in Germany. Meanwhile I have started to learn how to use Canva for marketing, I have completed a private chef and owner course in Turkey. I worked for a short while in Germany as cook after that I opened my own restaurant in Istanbul with a partner. I was planning to continue to live in Germany and hoping to be able to manage it from far away. It was quite difficult to manage the restaurant from Germany. Therefore I sadly decided to close it.</p>

<p>After all my carrier and experiences, I asked to myself which job is going to be a future job and what will bring the biggest change in the world? The answer was Technologie.  Therefore I have decided to start from somewhere to learn the AI and machine programing. After my research I have planned a roadmap for achieving my goals. I have started to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript from scratch.</p>
